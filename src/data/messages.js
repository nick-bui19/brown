      "Hey bb,",
      "I hope this letter puts a smile on your face. We may be on opposite sides of the planet, but I’ve never felt closer to you. Between our daily FaceTimes, little Locket check ups, Eggmon questions, texting, etc, ..., you've fully been woven into a part of my life.",
      "You call me while you're doing skincare, driving for groceries, even when you're working in a coffee shop. And you let me do the same. Every day, some times multiple times a day, but every time I feel loved, safe, and unbelievably grateful.",
      "And when you take a FT photo of me, or say my hair is pet-table, or just stare at me lovingly through me screen, and I pretend to protest,.. I actually secretly like it. It's proof that you care about me.",
      "Long distance means that we need to adapt and learn new rhythms together, whether that means figuring out what times work best for us, deciding to do a work-date or to binge watch Perfect Match, or balancing my morning routine with how late you sleep. I built this website with a bunch of cool features to make that adaptation process easier, but also just to be a hub and proof of our relationship.",
      "Just like you said it the first month, and it’s even truer now: I'm so happy to get to know you a little more every day. I don’t know exactly where the next chapter will take us, but I do know that I’ll keep thinking of you (and Brown, I guess and Rocket too), being there for you, and counting down the days when I see you again.",
      "Happy three months, Tina.",
      "Love you :))))",

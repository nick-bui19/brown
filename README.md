# About the Project

<div align="center"> <img src="src/assets/screenshot.png" alt="LDR Project Screenshot" width="600" /> </div>
Nick’s Long-Distance Relationship Hub is a React single-page application built to help partners maintain closeness while apart. The app combines:

Dual Time Zone Clocks & Slider — Live clocks for Utah and Hanoi, plus a slider to convert times every 5 minutes.

Word of the Day (Vietnamese) — Fetches from Supabase based on Utah’s midnight, with translation and notes.

Photo Gallery — Responsive “favorite photo of the month,” with fluid resizing on all devices.

Inline Message Inbox — Lists heartfelt messages; click a title to expand it inline, with read/unread tracked via localStorage.

Countdown Timer — Real-time countdown until the next reunion, recalculated every second in Utah time.

All sections share a cohesive design with responsive breakpoints at 1200 px, 1024 px, 768 px, 600 px, 480 px, and 360 px to ensure no overflow on any screen size.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
